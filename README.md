# CDP Support Agent Chatbot

This project implements a chatbot that answers "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): **Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap**. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation of each platform and responds to user queries through a simple web interface.

## Features

- **Answer "How-to" Questions:** Guides users on how to perform tasks on various CDPs.
- **Documentation Extraction:** Automatically retrieves relevant documentation snippets.
- **Robust Query Handling:** Supports various phrasings and query types.
- **Cross-CDP Comparisons:** Provides side-by-side comparisons between platforms.
- **Security and Performance Enhancements:** Implements input sanitization, caching, and rate limiting.
